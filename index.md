Hi! This page will cover one theorem or mathematical idea every day. We will be addressing subjects from game theory all the way through analysis and number theory. Each entry offers a brief overview of the idea and, where relevant, goes over a problem or application.

This guide is NOT a comprehensive reference and is meant only as a quick and fun introduction.
